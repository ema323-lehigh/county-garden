Consideration for the ER diagram: what is at the center? What is the focus? Where does everything else flow from? The design is mainly non-hierarchical -- actually, no, the relational part is what's non-hierarchical - but whatever is seen first, whatever is central, will take most importance as a first impression.

Key tenets:
- each customer has one (dedicated) agent ALWAYS
- meanwhile, claims may be managed by multiple adjusters
- all policies must be held, claims made and managed, etc.
- no employee can be both an agent and an adjuster
- contractors may service as many or as few claims
- accordingly, not all claims are serviced
- we don't care about employees' information
- bills are expected to be paid, resulting in an initially null payment_type field
- unpaid policy premiums result in customers getting booted
- every claim is made against some individual policy, but not all policies have claims
- one invoice can make payments against multiple policies (? bundles)
- as policies can be new or cancelled, they do not have mandatory invoices
- a policy can only be held by one customer, no matter how many are insured
- likewise, a claim may only be made by a single customer
- dependents may NOT[1] belong to multiple customers (ex. divorce) & no floating
- a dependent is identified both by their name and their relationship to the customer (consider using DOB instead)
- at the moment, the design is open to non-insurance-oriented employees, just in case
- all policies must cover at least one item, and all items must be covered by at least one policy
- each payment goes towards one and only one claim, identified by its payment number on that claim
- quoted prices need not always be available, so they will be null at first
- all invoices are paid in full, while payments may be partial on claims
